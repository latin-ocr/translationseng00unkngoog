And louder than the bolts os hmv'n
¹ Far flash'd the red artillery.

5. But reddet yet that light shau glow · ’

On linden's hille of stained mov,
And bloodier yet the torrent fiow ,
Of laer rolling rapidly.

6. 'sis morn3 but scaroe yon level sun
Can pieroe the wardouds, rolling dun,
Where furious Frank and fiery Hun

Shont in their sulphurous eanopy.

7. ste combat deepem On, ye bruve!
Who ruah to glory or the grave,

Waw, Munieh 1 ull thy banners wave,
And charge with all thy chivulry.

8. Rev, few shall part, where many meet:
The mov shall be their winding eheet;
And every turf beneath their feet

shall be a soldier’s sepulchre.

SAILOR'S SONG.

1. While clouds on high are fiding
'she wintry moonshine hiding,
The raging blm abiding

O'er mountain vavas we go.
with hind the dry land παρίης,
with townsman shelter keeping,
with lond on sofo down sloeping

Ohange we our 1011 Oh no!
