SUNSET ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SEA.

How deer to me the hour, when daylight (fiee,
And sunbeems melt along the silent see!
F or then sweet dreems of other days erise,
And memory breathes her vesper sigh to thee
And es I wateh the line of light, which plays
Along the smooth wave tow’rd the burning west,
1 long to treed that golden path of rayS,
And think 'b would lead to some bright isle of rest.

THE RAINY DAY.

1. ΤΗΕ day is eold, and defle, end dreary3
It rains', end the wind is never weary:

The vine still elinge to the mouldering well, ·
But ae every gust the dead leaves fell,
And the day is derk end dreary. ·

2. My life is eold end dark and dreary3
It retine, end the wind is never weary. ·

My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,
But the hopes of youth sall thick in the blase,
And the days ere dark and dreery.

3. Be still, sed hem! and eease repining3
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining:
Thy fate is the common fate of all :

-Into eeeh life some rein must sell;
, Some days must be dark and dreary.
