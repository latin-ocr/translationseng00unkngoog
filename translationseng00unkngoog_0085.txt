Long may the fair and bravo
Sigh o'er fixe hero’s grave„
2 We’re fall'n upon gloomy days:
Stat after star decays. ι
Every bfight name, that shed
ljght o'er the land, is ssed
Dark falls the tear of him who monmeth
Lost joy, or hope that ne'er remmath :
But brighfly flows the tear,
Wept 0’er a hero’s bier.
3. Oh, quench'd are our bacon-lights!
Thou, of the hundred fights ἕ
Thou, on whose buming tongue
Truth, peace·and freedom hung!
Both mute ε but long as Valour shinoth,
01 Memfs soul at war repinekh,
So long shall Erin’s pride
Tell how they liffld and died

MASSACRE OF GLENOOR

Thy waywnrd notes of wail and πω

F ar down the desart of Glenme,
Where none may list their melody?

Say, hnrp’st thou to the mist-3 that fly,

Ortothedundeerglmcingby„

Or to the engle, that from high
Serenum chorus to thy minnela, ἒ
