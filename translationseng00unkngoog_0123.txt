7. Thensshou saw’st the settling ocean,
Calming from its wild commotion ;
, And less mighty than the first
Forth a new creation burst!

. Saw’st each created billow n‘fe
with ten thousand forms of life3
Saw'st the budding sea-weod grow
In the tmnquil deeps below,
· And within the ocean-mines
. Hourly branching corallineS.

. Thou didst know the sea, ere man
His first voyage had begun—
All the World hadst sailed about ·
Em America was found out ;

Ι Ere Ulysses and his men

sailed for Ithaca again ;
Ere among the isles of Greeoe,
Went J ason for the golden fleece.

. Thou wast sailing 0'er the sea,
Brave old voyager‚ merrily,
While within the forest grew
The τηε which made the first canoe„
During circumnavigator,
Would thou werss thine own narrator ἕ
