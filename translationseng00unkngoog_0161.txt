,ΤΗΕ VOIOE OF SPRING.

l. Ι corut, Ι come : ye have called me long:
I come 0’er the mountains with light and song.
Ye may trare my step 0'er the wakening earth
By the winde which tell of the violet's birth,
By the primmse-stnrs in the shndowy grans,
By the green leaves opening as Ι pass,

. I have brenth’d on· the south, and the chesnut flowem
By thousands hnve burst hom the forest-bowers ;
And the ancient graves and the fallen sanes
Are veil'd with wreaths on Italian pleins.

But it is not for me in my hour of bloom
Το speak of the ruin or the tomb.

. I have look’d 0'er the hills oi the stormy north,
And tn} nnn nas hung an ns essen forth,
And the fisher is out on the sunny sea,
And the reindeer bounds o’er the pasturas free 3
And the pine has a sringe of rofter green, ι
And the moss looks might, where my foot heth been.

. I have sent through the wood paths a gldwing sigh,
And ceil’d out each voice of the deep blue sky3
From the night hird's lay through the sterry time
In the graves of the soit Hesperien elime,

To the swmr’s wild note hy the Iceland lakes,
Where the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks.
