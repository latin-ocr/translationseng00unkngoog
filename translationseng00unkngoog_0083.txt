SEOTION III.

THE WOUND OF IRELAND.

1. As o boam o'er the foce of tho waters may glow,
While the tide mos in darkness and coldness below,
So tho oheek may be ting’d with a worm sunny smile,
Though the oold heart to ruin runs dorkly thewhile.

2. One fatal remembranoe, one sorrow, that throws
Ito bleok shado alike 0’or¹ our joys and oin woeS,

To whioh life nothing darker or brighton oon bring,
For which joy has no bahn and affliction no sting;

3. Oh, this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay,
Like a dead leafless branoh in tho summer's bright roy.
The beams of the worm sun play round it in vain ε
It may snn‘le in his light, but it blooms not again.

THE DnATH ANGEL.

1. How oft has the Benshee oried!
How oft has Death untied
Bright links that Glory wove,
Sweet bonds 'entwin’d by Iove!
. s Peaoe to each manly soul that sleepoth;
Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth.
