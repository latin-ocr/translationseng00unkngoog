THE ALBUM.

1. Tmbmkthevixginpage,
Whihemdunwritoensffll:

Some haud more enlm md nge
The leaf must- flu

'thoughts come, as pure aa fight3
Pme aa ev'n you require :

But oh! each word Ι mite,
Leve turns te fixe„

2. Yet let me keep the book 2
0st shall my beart mew,
When ou its leuvas I look,
Dear thoughts of you.
Like you, ’fiis ἐγὼ aud bright;
Like you, too bright und fuir,
To let wila Pession write
One wrong wish them.

3⁴ Haply, when frum those eyes

Fas, sm· away I inum,

Should calmet thoughts mise
Tow'rds you md home ;

Fancy may moe some line
Worthy those eyes to meet,

’flmughfs tha& not burn but ahiae,—
Pure, calm and sweess.
