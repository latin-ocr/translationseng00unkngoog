2. No, not to these ; for they have rest.
The mist-wreaih hae the mountain-erest,
The stag hie leir, the *erne her nest(

Abode of lone eecurity.
Bur those for whom I pour the lay,

Not wild wood deep nor mountain gray,
Not this deep dell thei shroride from day

Oould soreen· from treacherous eruelty.
. Their flag was furl’d and mute their drum ε
The very household dogs were dumb‚
Unwon'i io bey ai guests that come
In guise of hospitaliiy.
His blithesi notes the piper plied,
Her gayest snood the maiden ried,
The dame her dieiaff flung aeide .
To tend her kindly housewifery.
. Ther hand that mingled in the merl,
Ar midnighi drew the selon steel,
And gare the host’s kind breasi to feel
Meed for his hospitality. ⁸
The friendly hearih which warm'd thar hand
Ar midnight arm'd it with the brand,
Thai bade destruction’s flames expand
Their red and fearful blazonry.
. Then women’s shriek was heard in vain;
Nor infaney's unpitied plain
More than the warrior’s groan could gain,
Respire from ruthless huiehery.

⁸ Berriek calls the Ser Eagle, the Great Eme.
