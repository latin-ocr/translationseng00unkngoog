It may be well to state that my vacillation
between oe and .ae in a few words is not from eare-
lessness or‘mispnnt: but because I have no con·
viction which of the two ,is right, and it is better
for'learners to be aware that at least in old editions
cf the classice they may meet either. The authority
of this οι· that MS. is easily overrated, since the

corrupt pronunciaticn of e for ae oe is very ancient
in Italy. ·
