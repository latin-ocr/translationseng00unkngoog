And e‘mohher she wne ond r'e to me ;
ForIwas born on the open See! ‘

5. The wevee were white, end red the morn,
In the noisy hour when Ι was born;
And the whole it whietled the porpoise rolled,
And the dolphins bared their books of gold ;

, And never was heard such an outory wild

As weleomed to life the ooeon child!

6. I've lived since then, in oelm end stris ,
Fun fifty summere a seilors life,
With weolth'to spend and e power to range,
But never heve sought, nor sighed for change ;
And Death wheneuer he comesto me,
Shell come on the wild unbounded seo. ·

1. Ur, up! let us a voyage take!
Why sit we here et enee 2
Find ue ovessel right end snug,
Bound for the N orthern sees.
2. Ι long to see the Norhhern lights,
With their ruehing splendente, fly
Like living things with fleming winge,
Wide o’er the wondroue shy.
3. I long to see those iceberge vasi,
With heede all erown'd with sn0w‚
Whose green roots sleep in ‘ohe owful deep
Two hundred fethoms low.
