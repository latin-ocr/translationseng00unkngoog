O my sed hem, long abandon'd by pleasm

Why did it doat 011 a fast-fading treesuxe2

hears, like the mindrop, may fell without measure ;
But repture and beauty they cannot recall

5. Yet, all its sed recollectione suppmssing, .

One dying wish my lone bosom een drew:

Erin! 'an exile beqyeaths thee his blessing;
Laud of my forefethers! Erin-go-breght

Buried and eold when my heare stills ite motion,

Green be thy fields‚ sweetesh isle of the oeean!

And thy harpetrildng harde sing eloud with devotion,
Erin mavoumin! Erin-gebregh! ’

MIDNIGHT BEFORE OORINTH.

’Tls midnight. On the mountains brown
The eold round moon shines deeply down
Blue roll the wetere : blue the sky
Spreads like an ocean hung on high
Bespangled with those isles of light

So wildly spiritually bright.

Who ever gaz'd upon them shining

And tum’d to earth without repining‚
Nor wish'd for wings to fiee away

And mix with their eterne] ray?

The waves on either shore lay there,
Celm, clear and azme as the eir;

And searee their foam the pebbles shook,
But murmur’d meekly es the brook
