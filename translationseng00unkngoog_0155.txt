The western wilds among, ¹

And hee in green Columbia’s woods
rhe hunter's bow is sorung.
But let the floods rush on :
Iet the arrow's flight be sped :

Why should they reok, whose took is done?
Thero slumber England's dead.

5. The mountain-storms rise high

In tho snowy Pyronees,

And toss the pino-boughs through the sky,
Like rose-leaves on the hreeze.
nuo let the stonn roge on:
Iet the fresh wreaths be shed ε

For the Ronoesvalles’ field is won ;-
Thero elumber England's deod.

6. On the frozen deep’s repose
'ris o dark snd droedful honr,
When round the ship the ioefields close,
And tho northern night-clouds lour.
⁹ But let the ioe drife on 1
Let the oold blue desert spread!
mir course with mast and flag is done:
Ev’n there sleep Englond's deod.

7. The warhke of the isles,
The men of field end weve,
