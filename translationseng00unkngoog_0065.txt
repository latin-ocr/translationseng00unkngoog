2. On Inugh Neagh’s bank as the fieherman σὴψ
When the clear, eold eve’s declining,
lle eees the Ronnd Towera 01 other days
ln the vave beneath him ehining„
Thus shall Memory osten in dreame sublime
Gatnh a glimpee ofthe days that are over3

Thus, eighing, look through the wavee 01 time
For the long faded gloriae they cover

BAl'l'LE OF HOHENLINDEN.

1. 011 Linden, when the sun was low,
All bloodless lay the nntrodden enow,
And derk as winter was the flow

01 Iser rolling rapidly.

2. But Linden saw another eight,

When the drurn beat at dead 01 night,
Commanding fires 01 death to light
The darkness 01 her seenery.

3. By toreh and trumpet fast arr-esd,
Each horseman drew hia battle-blade3

And furious every charger neigh'd
To join the dreadful nevelryq
4 Then ahook the hille with thunder 11111,
Then rush’d 1110 steed 10 battle driv'n,
