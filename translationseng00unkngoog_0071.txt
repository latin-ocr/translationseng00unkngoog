3. Save thus, our night-watch keeping '
stom-winde to bravo,
Whjle the very sea-bird sleeping
Rests inhts eave.

Think of us, when hearths are gleaming;
Think of us, when mead is streaming;
Ye, of whom our souls are dreaming

3 On the ‹lark wave.

TURKISH SUNSET.

1. WARM o’er the waters the red suuis glowing: ,
'Tis the'last· parting glanee of his splendouhhnd might:
while each rippling wave on the bright shore is throm'ng

Its white erest, that breaks inho showers of light.

2'. Each distant mosque and minaret
Is shining in the setting sun,
Whosb farewell look is brighter yet
Than that with which his course begun.

3. On the dark blue mountains his smile is bright:
5st glows on the orange-grove's waving height,
And breaks through its shade in long lanes of light.

4. No sound 011 the earth and no sound invthe sky,
Save murmuhing founbains that sparkle m'gh,
And the rusffling' *ssight of the evening breeze,
Who steals from his nest in the -cypress hreeS,

⁸ Scapha, shaft (οἱα pillar), here used sor Minaoet.
