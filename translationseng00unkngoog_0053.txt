4„ What a King! He fought and venquiehcd
Lombard, Seraeen, Saxcn, still
Ruling every racc he conquered
ι With a deep consummate skffl. Ι
Once alone false Fortune checked him,- ²
Once, on Roncesvallc's plain ε
Save that day, all else was cloudless Ι Δ
Thrcugh the time of Charlemagne. ⁵

5. But—hc died! and he was buricd
In his ’ccmb cf sculpturcd stone ;
And they robed and placed his body
Uprighc cn his golden throne ;
¹With his ewcrd and with the biblc
ι, „Which through life he did maintain,
’ 'All strewn o’er with gcms and spices,
Sabe the dead King Charlemagne!

6. Since his time, che wbrld is altercd3
. Yet,—let’s hope to ece again,
All the sword's old velem, mingled
With the wisdom of the pen:
ΤΗΙ those days shall come, dcar Poete,
⁴ lec us not perplex cur braim
But, content, love truth and valour
Though intime of Cherlemcgne.
