Speek as if it were given to thee
To list to seraphin minstreley.
Ay: there thou hest been Not sunny Franoe
Or old Italie’s land of song, '
can surnish euch notes for the poet’s denne
Ae the melody pour’d fmm thy musical tongue

4 Where hest thou been, my beautiful Spn'ng3
Plueking n'ch plumes from the puoquet’s wing?
Robbing the clouds of their minbow erest?
Bething thyuelf in the glorious west!

Robing thy form in the peeeook's hum,
And gethering pearls from the orient devs?
mse, whenoe comest thou with this pmud army

Os beautiae to sprinkle the russet wod,
These lentrliliee bending as if to pmy,

And hyacinthe fi'inging the merge of the flood?

. And tell me, whenee comem—my beautiful spring!

Eeeh ster os the emh, eeeh odomus thing ;

These whiteffinged deisiee with goldendipped eya

These buttemups gleeming like summer-lit skiee.
