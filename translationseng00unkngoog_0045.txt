6. The moon uprising like a sun,
, 80 stetely, large end sheen,
And the very 01010, like oluster’d moons,
In the oryslel ether keen.

7. While all about the ship below
strange fie1y billows play, -
’ Τ10 oeaseless keel through liquid fire
(luis wondrously its way.
8. But oh l the South, 110 balmy 8011111
How worm the breezes 110011
How worm the amber walens stream ’
From off our basking boot!
9. Come down, oome down from' the 1011 ship’s side:
What a marvellous sight is here!
Look 1 purple rooks and orimson 11000,
Down in the deep so oleer.
10. See where those shools 01 dolphins go,
A glad and glorious band,
Sporting among the daybright woodo
01 o ooral feiry land.
11. See on the violet sande beneath
How the gorgeous shello do glide 1‘
Ο 800, old Sea! who yet knows half
, 01 thy wonders and thy pride?
12. Look, how 110 seoplents trembling 11001,
All like a mermaid’s looks,
Waving in thread of ruby red
Over those nether rocks,
