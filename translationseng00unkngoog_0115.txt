A MOORISH SERENADE

Son the moonbeam ereepeth Ι mund hm· bow’r all night.

Thou gentle, gentle breem, Ι while my lady slumbers,

Wast light-ly through the trees Ι eohoes of my numbers
Her dmming ear to plesse*

Should ye,—breathing1mmbess‚ Ι that for her 1 wemm—
Shnuld ye boeak her slumbers, Ι all my soul would grieve.
Rise ou the gentle breem Ι ancl gaiu her lactine height,

As hum of distant bem

Lu the stream scm-ce flowing Ι mimia lustres lie.

Blow, blow gentle bteeze, Ι buz bring no cloud bo hid«.-

Their deus msplendenoies ς Ι nor chase fiom me's side
Dravus bright aud pure ns these.
