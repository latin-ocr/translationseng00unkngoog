Where'e the hand to wmathe them ?
Songs emund neglected lie :
Where's the lip to breathe them 2
Spring may bloom; but she we low d Ι
Ne'er shall feel its sweetness.

THE SEA GULL

1. Bnm of the Ocean, Ι graeefulinmotion, ,
Swift in thy passage from inland to sea!
0st I in fancy paee Ι over thy dwellssng plaee,
Dear to thy nestlings, and precious to me.
2. Bright in eccentrie ssight, Ι gleaming with purast white,
Floating through ether all buoyant and free!
Raptur'd I’ve seen thee swerve Ι from thy fantastie curve,
Dropping wieh eallnote to sport on the lea.
3. Ost when the billows soem, Ι far from thy native home,
Shelter’d by woodland, near meadow and br00k;
Ower arugged stile Ι thoughtful I've lean’d awhile
Watehing thee play with some blaekamoor rook
4. And on the shore I’ve stood, Ι marking thy enowy brood
Dive neath the silvee wave, eeerching for prey ;
