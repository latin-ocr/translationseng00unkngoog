SEOTION ΙΙ.

1. Yn mariners of England
· · who guard onr native sees,
Whose flag has brav'd, a thousand years,
The battle and the bmeze5
Your glorions standard launeh again
Το match another foe, -
’ And sweep through the deep
While the stormy tempests hlow.
While the battle rages lond and long
·’ And the stormy tempests blow.
2. The spirits of your fathers
Shall stant from every ware ; ·’
For, the deek‚ it was their field of fame,
And oeean was their grave
where elne ano mighey nenos fen, ’
Your manly hearts shall gloss,
As ye sweep through the deep,
While the stormy tempests blow,
While the battle rages lond end long
And the stormy tempests blow.
3. Britannia needs no hulwark
No tow'rs along the steep :
Her march is 0'er the mountain-nave,
Her home is on the deep.
