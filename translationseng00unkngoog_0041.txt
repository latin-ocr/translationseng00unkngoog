4. Ι long to hear the thund’ring orash
0f their tsrrifio fall,
And the eohoes from a thousand oliffa
Like lonely voices, call
5. There shall we see the fieroe white bear,
The sleepy seals aground,
And the sponting wholes, that to and fro
Sail with‘a dreary sound.
6. There may we tread on depths of iee
That the hairy mammoth hide,
Perfeot, as when in times of old
The mighty creature died. -
7. And while the unsetting sun shines on
' Thmugh the still hearne deep blus,
, We'll traversa the azure arares, the herde
Ostha dread sea-horse to view,
8. We'll pass the shores of solemn pina,
Where wolves and blaok bears prow13
And away to the rooky isles of mist,
Το ronse the northern fowl
9. Up there shall start ten thousand wings
With a rushr'ng whistling din 3
Up shall the auk and fulmar stad,—
All but the fat penguin
10. And there in the wastes of the silent sky,
With the silent earth below, ·
We shall see far off to his lonely rook
. The lonely eagle go.
11. Thon softly softly will we treed
By inland streame, to see,
