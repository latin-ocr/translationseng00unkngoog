The winde were pillowd on the werce ;
The berners drocp'd along their eleves ;
And ee they fell eround them hirling,
Above them ehone the crescent curliug:
And thar deep silence wce unbrcke,

Save where the weheh his signal spoke;
Save where the eteed neigh'd 0st and ehrill,
And echo enswer’d from the hill; '
And the wide hum of chae wild hoel
Rustled like leaves from coesi to coast,

Ae rose the Muezzirr's voice in¹ cir,

In midm'ghi cell io wonled prajr :

It rose, that chented moumful swein,

Like some lone epirit's o’er the plain.
'Twce musical, 'twae sedly eweet;

Such as when winde and herpstrings mech,
And take along unmeaeur'd tone

To morial minelreley unknown

THE WATERFALL.

1. Thr waterfall! the waterfall!
How eounde ils sweet melodicus cell ’
The Alpino valleys through!
It elreaks the derk rcck’e dietant side;
Ite soem upon the eir doth ride.
Thou beautiful! the mountain's bride;

Fer glidirrg into view.
