METRIOAL NOTIOE.

In Ssorror L pieoes 1 to 4 certain lhe common Hexemeters
and Pentemeters. In 5 to 11, the Iambio Dimeter‘is added

to the Dactylio Hexameter, as in Horace, Epod. 14 end 15.

In Ssonos H. the Anopeestio systems are quite regular,
except in 22, where an Anapaestie is followed by an Iombio
Dimeter. Ι know no precedent,for this. My only justificetion
is, that it seemed to suit fhe pieoe.

In Ssorros 111. the Ohon‘ambies are either es in Horace
or as in Catullus. In Ssorros IV: the innovetion is chiefly
in the composition of stanzas. No. 54 hes en initial syllable
in orroeos, which is often ealled Ionio a mojori. No( 59 has

a Euripides-11 line, which gives some wildness.

The metros of ermon V. need no particular remark,
except thas 70-72‚ being Deotylio÷1embie, might hove been
olassed with 5—113 end that 76, 77 eontein Troeheios ond¹
Oretios (-υ-).

On Sernes VI. remarks are made in the Note ot the
end.
