3. Cheerily then fmm hill and vnlley, choerily oh!
Like yout native fountains sully, choerily oh!
lfa glorious death. Ι won by διανοῇ,
sweeter be than breath Ι sigh’d in slavery,
Round the flag of Freedom mlly, cheerily oh!

THE SEA-KING.

00ss sing, come sing, of the greafl SeaeKing.
And the fame that now hange o’er him,
who once did sweep o’er the vanquished deep, . ¹
And drove the world before him Ι
His deok was a throne, on the ocean lone,
And thesea was his park of plausum,
Where he scattered in sear the human dedr,
And rosted,—when he had leisure!

Oome‚-shout and sing

of the great Sea-King‚
And ride in the track he rode in Ι ’
He sits at the head
of the mighty dead
On the red right hand of Odinl ’

He sprang, from birth, like a God on θεῶ,
And soared on his vietor pinions,
And he traversed the sea, as the eagles fleo, ,
When they gaze on their blue domininus,
His whole emh-life was a conquefing atrise,
And he lived till his heard gmw hoary‚
And he died at last, by his blood-red mut,
And now—he is lost in gloxy.

So‚-shout and sing, διο.
