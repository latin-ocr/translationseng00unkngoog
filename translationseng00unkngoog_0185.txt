Sweet voice of eomsoii! ’tvos like lhe slenling
i of summer wind through some winethed ehell3
Eeoh secret winding, each inmosi feeling
of nll my sonl eohoed to ils spell
'Tvas vhisper'd helm; ’tvae snnshine spoken:
I’d live years oi grief and pain,
Το heve my long oleep of sorrow bmken
'ny ench beniQn blessed sounde again.

'l'HE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.

1. Un'nnn a spreading eheslnut tree
The village smilhy stands.
The smith, e mighty mon is he,
With louge and sinewy hands,
And the museles of his hrnvvny erm
Are strong ns iron bonde
2 Hisheir is cnisp and hleok end long3
His fece is like the ten : .
His hrow is wet with honest sweet: -
He earns vvhate’er he ean,
And looks the whole world in the faoe;
¹ · For he oves not any men.
3. Week in, week ont, from morn to night,
You ean hear his bellove blow ε
Yon oen hear him owing his heavy sledge
’ With meesur'd beat and slew,
Like a sexion ninging the village bell
· When the evening sun is low.
