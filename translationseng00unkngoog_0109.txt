The glow of the sunshine the belm of the eir,
Would steel to our heexhe end make all summer there.
With affection as free
From decline ee the bow’m,
And with Hope, like the hee,
Living always on flowhe,
Our life should resemble along dey of light,
And our death come on holy end calm ee the nighh.

THE BREEZE FROM· SHORE.

1. Jov is upon the lonely sees,
When Indien foreste pour
Foxhh to the billow end the hoeeze
Their odoure from the shore:
J oy, when the soh air's fanning sigh
Bears-on the breath of Araby.
2. Ο welcome arethe winde that tell
A wanderer of the deep,
Where ser away the jesmines dwell
And where the myrrh trees weep.
Blest, on the eounding surge and soem,
Are tidings of the eitron’e home.
3. The seilor ab the helm they meet,
And hope his bosom stim,
Upepringing mid the waves ho gheet
The fair Eexhh'e messengers3
