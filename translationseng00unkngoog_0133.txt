Thau ιο the surfaoe τῖες, Ι sou- to the fleecy skies,
Coo to thy euml-ades, :md hasten away.

All the fair regium of iancy exploro.

THE EAGLE.

. Nor in the meadow and not on the ahons,

And not on the wide haath with fun-ze eovemd o’er,
Where the cry of the plover, the hum οἲ the bee,

(five a feeling ofjoyful security;

And not in the wooth when-athe nightiugale‘s song
From the chesnut and orange pom-s ull the day long;
Antl not where the maxtin has built in the eavea,-

Aud the tedbreasz once cover’d the nhil-hen with leaves ;—
Shnss ye find the pmud engle. Oh, no! oome away!

I will show you his dwening. and point out his poey.
Away! let us go where the mountaim are high,

With tall splint'ring pem tow'ring into the sky ;

Where old min’d castles m dmm-y and lone,

And seem as ix* built for a world that ia gone.

There, up on the wpmost toer, blank as hbe night,

Sita the old monarch engle in full blaze of light.

He is king os these mountain Save him and his mate,
Nm eughz ἀνῶ-18 here ι he is 1011er md great.

Lnok, look how he sits, with his keen ghnoing eye

And his prend head thmwn back, looking into the sky.
