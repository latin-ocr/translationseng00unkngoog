THE AROTIO LOVER

1. GoNss is the long long winter night.

Look, my beloved one, η
How glorious‚ thro' his depths of light,

Rolls the majestic sun!

The willows, wak’d fmm winter’s death
Give out a fiugrance like thy breath: ἵ
The summer is begua
d. Ay! ’tis tho long bright summer day: Ι

Hark to the mighty crash! Ι
The loosen’d ioeridge breaks away :

The amitten waters flaeh
Seaward the glittering mountain rides,
While down its goeen translucent sides

The foamy torrente dash

3 . See, love 1 my boat is moor’d for thee

By Ocean’s weody floor.

The petml does not skim the sea

More swiffly than my oar.

We’ll go, where on the mcky isles
Her eggs the seoemng senfowl pilas
Besidoe the pebbly shom
. Or bide thou whom tho poppy blows
with wind flow‘rs fm'l aad fair,
Wu'le Ι, upon his isle of snow,

Seek and defy the bear.
Remetho'hebeandhugeoffinme,
This arm his sange emgffl shall tame,

And ἀπε him fmm h'n hir.
