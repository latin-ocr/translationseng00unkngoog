Save when adown the ravag’d globe

He travels on his native sturm,
Deflowering Nature'e grassy robe,

And trampling oh her feded form,
Till light's returning loni assume

The abest that drives him to hie polar field,

Of pow'r to pierce his raven plume
And czyetd-eover'd ehielth

0 sire of storms! whose savage ear

The Lapland drum delighte to hear,
When Frenzy with her bloodshot¹ eye
Invokes thy dreedful deity ;
Amhengel Ι pow’r of desolation!
Fest deseending as thou ert,
Say, heth mortel invocation
Spells to touch thy stony heare?
Tben sullen Winter, hear my prajr,
And gently mle the ruin'd year,
Nor chill the wenderer's bosom bare,
Nor freeze the wretch’e falling tear.
To shuddering Want’s unmantled bed
Thy horror-breathing agnes oense ho lend,
hnd gently on the orphan head
Of Innocence descend.

But chiefly spere, 0 king of clouds!

The sailor in hie airy shroud33

When wrecks and beacons strew the sheep,
And speohes welk ,along the deep.
