lmrderl As to verses called Lyric, Ι do as Horace
and Catullus themselves did-go to the Greeks for
the foundation, and compact the lines into stanzas
suited for the material before me.

Eton masters in old days would not permit to
boys such rhythm as Virgil himself uses, and
obtruded into the third line of the Alcaic a restric-
tion unknown to Horace. Not that Ι would claim
every liberty for which there is precedent, even in
Catullns3 much less in the dromas known by the
name ol Seneca, which carry monotony of lyric
metro to its maximum. Before the single Choriamb
Catullus and the Greeks seem to prefer a Troohee
to a Spondeo, and allow an Iamb. These I follow
rather than Horace. YetbeforeadoubleOhoriamb
the Spondee is perhaps necessary.

Many treat it as an inadmissible Graeciam to
shorten, instead of ehding, a long vowel before a
short3as18imbamas311i6alto: Pelid Ossam

On the contrary, elision is primdscoic the liberty,
and the practice of the Greeks alone intelligibla.
Elision is here a great paradox; for it seems as
though adding a vowel made a phrase shorter.
,For instance, Vidi equidem, satisfias Virgil asa
Oboriamb ; but Vidi quidem is too long, too heavy.
What theory will explain this?
