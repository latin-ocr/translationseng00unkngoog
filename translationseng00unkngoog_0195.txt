Oh, thu last ruys of feeling and life must depost,

Ere the bloom of that valley ahau fade from my haut„

Yet it ww not that Natum had ahad o'es the me
Her puroet oserysfal am‘l brighoest ofgreeu:

Who made every deu· soene of enehantment mum dean

And who felt how the beet ohanne of nature imprumy
When we sep them reflected from looks that we love.

Sweet vale of Ovouax how cal-m wulcl Ι rest
