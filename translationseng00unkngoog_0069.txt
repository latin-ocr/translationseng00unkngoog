2. On stormy waves careering,

Each seamate seamate oheering‚ Ι

111111 dauntless helmsman steering
Our forthward course we holn

Their sails with sunbeams whiten'd

Themselves with glory brighten'd,

From care their bosoms thten’ss
Wno shall return? The bold. ·

1. 'Wnncn ye well! the moon is shrouded

On her bright throne.

Storms ane gathering: stans are clouded:
Waves make wild monn. ’

’Tis no night of hearthfires glowing,

And gay songs and wine-cups flowing;

But of winds, in darkness blowing¹
O'er sens unknown.

¹2. In the dwellings of our fathers
Round the glad blazn
Now the festive oircle gathers
With hanps and layS.
Now *bhe the rushstrewn haus nne ninging‚
Steps are bounding, bards are singing:
Ay, the hour to all is bringing
Pence, ·j0y or praise,
