SILVAN RETIREMENT.

Α. Ooven me with your everlasbing arms,
Ye guardian gients of this solitude
nom ne n1 signe osmer, aad from no ‘rude
Tumuliuous din of yon wide world’s elerms.
Β. Oh knit your mighly limbs emund, above,
And elose me in ior ever 2 lei me dvvell
with lhe woedspiriis3‚in lhe derkesi spell* .
. Theb ever with your vendent loeks ye wove.
e. 'l'he eir is full oi eountless voices, join'd
In one eiernel hymn i-ihe whispering wind,
The shuddering leaves, the hidden weierspringr,
The worksong oi the bees, whose honey'd wings
1). Hang in the golden irenses of the lime, -
Or buried lie in purple bede of thyme.

HARP OF THE NORTH.

1. e Hine oi the North, that mouldering long hesi hung
On the wyehe elm, inae shndes Si Fillen’s spring,
e. And dovvn ilie fiefn breene thy numbers flung,
Till envious ivy did eround thee eling,
Muffling with verdeni ringlet every siring ;-
c. Ο minstrel herp‚ still must thy eeeenis sleepl
Mid metling leaves end founieins murmuring, .
Stin must thy sweeter sonnds their silence keep,
n. Nor bid e warrior smile, nor ieseh e maid to weepl
