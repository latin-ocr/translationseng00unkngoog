Fire tunneth him not, nor sea preventa :
He is stronger by fer than the elementa.
The broad green earth is his prostrate prey,
And he darkens the sun at noon of day.

THE CHILD OF THE ΒΕΑ.

1. Tun sea! the ses! the open sea!
The blue, the fresh, the ever free!
Without a mark, without a bound,

lt rrmneth the earth's wide regions 'round3
' It plays with the clouds 3 it mocks the aliea,
Or like a eradled creature lies. ’
2, I’m on the sea! I’m on the sea!
I am where I would ever be;
With the blue above and the blue below
And silence whereso’er I go;
If a storm should come end wake the deep,
What matter? I shall ride and sleep.
3. Ilove (ohl how I love) to ride Ι
On the fieree ioaming bursting tide,
When every mad wsve drowns the moon,
Or whistles aloft his tempest tune,
And tells how goeth the world below,
And why the south west blasts do blow.
4. I never was on the dull tame shore, ·
But Ι loved the great sea more and more,
· And baakwards flew toher billowy breast,
Like a bird that seeketh its mother’s nest:
