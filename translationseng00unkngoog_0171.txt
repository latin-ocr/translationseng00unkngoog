Iu vain the hero's hart luth Ναὶς

The sage's Longae hath wam’d in vain ι

Ο Fmedom! ⁰¹1oe thy flnme bath fied,
It never lights again.

Δ Weep nn! perhaps in aster days
Thsy'n leam ω love your ιιιιιιως
When many a deod shall wake in puina,
Thac now munt sleep in blame,
And when they mad the ruin'rl isle,
Where rest nt length the loni und dave,

They'll wondering ank, how hands so vile ’

Could oonquex hm ao bravo.

. ’Twus Faba (they'll say) n wuywud Fata
Your weh of din-„ord wove;

And while your tynum joined in habe,
Yuu never join'd in love.

But heuto fell off, that ought to twine,

And man prosm'd, what Gud bath given,

'riu some wem heard to muse the shrine,
Where others kuele to heaven.

scema FISHERMAN'S SONG.

1. O smmv glides the bonny bont
Just pal-ted stom the ehem,
And ω the flaheis ahana-note
Sost moves the dipping ons.
