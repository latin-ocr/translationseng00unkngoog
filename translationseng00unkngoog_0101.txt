VENIOE ΒΥ NIGHT.

N leur in her dcrk orray Ι eteols 0’er theeman,
And with departod dey Ι hush’d seems its motion

Slowly 0'er yon blue coest Ι onward she's treading,
Till its dark line is lost Ι neoth her vell spreading.

1111 burk on'the ripphng deep Ι heth found a pillou'‚ .
And the pale mconbeams sleep Ι on the green billow.

. Bound hy her 'emercld zone Ι Venice is lying,

And round her marble crown Ι night winde are sighing
From the high lattiee now Ι bright eyes cre gleaming‚
Thot seem on night'e derk brow Ι brighter staro beaming.
N ow o’er the blue legoon Ι light barke are dunning,
And neoth the silver moon Ι swin cers are glaucing.
Strainn from the mondolio Ι steal 0’er tho water:
Echo replies between Ι to mirth and laughter.

O’er the wave seen esar Ι brilliantly shining‚
Gleoms like e fallen star Ι Venice reclining.

THE STORMY PETREL.

. A ruonsnrn miles from land ere we,

Tossing about on the roaring eea;

From billow to hounding billow cest,

Like fleecy snow on the stormy hlast: ’

The soils are scattered about like weeds;

The strong ‘macte shake, like quivering recds;
The mighty nobles end iron chains,

The hull, which ell earthly strength dicdum&
They strein end they crack; end heerte of stone
Their natural hard proud strength disown.
