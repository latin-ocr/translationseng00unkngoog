THE LONE SEA SHORE.

ΒΥ the lone sea shore Ι mournfiflly beat the waves.
Moumfnlly evermore Ι the wild wind nobs and neves.
A sadness and a sense of deep tmrest
Bmod 011 the clouds and 011 the weter's b1east.
But 10! the white sea mew eareering Ι flente indolently by3
And lo! asnowy sail appenning Ι gleams sair against the ³qu
The sadness and the loneliness depan,
And Nature smiles with sympathy of heart.
From snowy mountain peak Ι how sedly we look down ·
On pmple moorlend bleak Ι ungledden'd by a town!
The solemn grendeuris akin ho pain:
We look for sympathy end sigh in vain
Butif we hear the hine deep lowing Ι or voice of chnntielee1‚
Or wateh the azure smohe upfiowingffiom contege homesheads
The lonely landseape glittersinthe sight, [mah
And human gladness rohes it with deh'ght.

SPRING.

1. 'Tlsmenyinthe mead
When ‘enee end fiow'r and weed

Unfold their hender leefiete to wanhon in the spring3
When the linnet in the croft
And the lark a mile alost
And the hlaekbird in the hhieket attune their throats to sing.
