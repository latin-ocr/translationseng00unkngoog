3. Mnch doth know 1110 1101111111 thler, ἱ
More the great Pacific scilcr;
’ 11111011οω, 011111 gray,
In old times knew more than-them
But, 0111 dnn'ng voyeger small
More 111011 1111011001 then they all!
- Thou didsc laugh 111 sun and brecze
On the new 01001011 sees τ
4. . Thou wast with the dragcn brocds
In the old sec solitudes,
Sailing in the new-made light
With the stcny ammonite 1
5. Thou didst survive the ewful shock
Thac turned the ocean-bed 10 rock3
And changed its myiind living swarms
Το the mcrble's veined forms—
Fossil scrolls 111111 tell of change
Sudden, tenible and strange!
. Thou wast there! ‘chy little boat,
Airy vcycger, kept 1111001
O’er the waters wild and dismal,
O'er the yawning gulis abysmei
Amid wreck end overtuming,
Book-imbedding, heaving‚ buming-
Mid the tumult and 1110 stin,
Thou, 111001 ancient mariner,
In 111111 pearly boat of 1111110,
’ Set'sb upon the troubled brine 1
