20. See how the 1011 palms 1111 their looks

From mountain eliste! what 10100,
Basking beneeth the neonlide sun,
That high and hotly 001101
21. Yet all about the breezy shore,
Unheedful of 1110 glow,
Look how the children of the South
Are passing 10 and fro 1
22. What noble forms! what fairy place!

Push out the boat : for in 11110 land
Α 111110 we muel rove.

We’ll sit beneaih 1110 vine :
Well drink the limpid eoeoa-milk ὅ
And pluck 1110 native pine.
24. The breadhuil and 00000101001,
And many a glowing beny
She-ll be our 10001 : for here 01 least
Why should 101 we be menyi
25. For ’110 0 Southern Paradise,
All gladsome; plain and shore:
A land 00 far, that here we 010,
Bul shall be here no more, ,

110 sees and isles and men:
So now, beck 10 0 (100101 land,
Το England back again!
