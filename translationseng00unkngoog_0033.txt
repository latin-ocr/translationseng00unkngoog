Other than sonorouo, wild and hoe,
To mountain glory wod 1
Thy sistam oro the louwine’o tour,
Tho glacier's oustolluhod floor,
Tho shoet of snow, whioh manuleo o’er
'The tall peok's neodling heah
7. Famwell! though now thy beauty seems
No more the presago of my (1111111111,
Α mighty thing, whose image boemo
' With glory yet unsoen3 '
still wast thou beautiful ond bfight
As ho my vioionmy sight
When by thoe I have boen
8. Thy voil of lighh is on my eye,
And on my oar it cannot dio-
Thy musio’s distant sounth
What lovoly spirit throado her way
Through thy 111111 labyrinth of spu-ay,
I know not: but a thought will say,-
How glorious thou wouh found!
