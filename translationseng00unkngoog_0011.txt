J If any toacher use these pieoes as I design them,

be cultivated, and has in my opinion been unwisely
’ given up or lessened since I was a schoolboy. The
knowledge of the English pieres will aid to econo-

idea of the sense of the Latin. If the pupil be
allowed to take irnproper advantage, it will be
entirely the tcachers fault, who ought to catechisc
him on the exact meaning of the Latin wordsas
well as on the structure.

To imitate the style of one particular author, or
borrow from a poet his combinatione of words, is·
so evidently a grave fault, that it is wonderful how
it has been thought a virtue. To imitate even the.
rhythm of oue poet exclusively, can only be justified
by a general contempt ol the rest. As Ι do not
use continuous Hexameter (which demands a high
subject) I need not claim a right to end the verse

occasionally with a word of five syllabica, as does ³
Lucretius. But if a Pentameter be good enough ,

for Tibullus or Catullus, I do not care to ask
whether Ι cau find like 'verses in Ovid. Transla-
tionis always hard enough ε why make it artificially
