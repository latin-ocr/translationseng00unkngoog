1. Ο musi not to tho gun andvtho oword: ¹
iim spear of tho unboiievor premiis.
Boo Khnlloom, the good ond the bravo is fallen :
Who oan now be sosoi
2. An tho moon among the little stans,
Such was Boo Khalloom among mon.
What defenoe henooforth oon Fezzan hope to find?

3. ‘Men moum in silent sadness 'for his loss:
Women sob and shriok,
Bending the ain with their ories.

For as a shepheni to his flook,

4. θὶνο him songsl give him musio i
But what songs oan oqual his praisoi
His heart was as lorge as the desum, .,
His money bogs nomish’d all his pooplo, 1
Like tho rioh. udder of tho she camel,
Ovefflowing with abundant streams of milk.
