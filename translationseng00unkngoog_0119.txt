Oi hosenipi leaves that are dropping round,

And half involves the woodland meze

Where wimpling iissue from the gaze

Of beauty wan end pale.

THE NAUTILUS.

1. Lm: en ocean-breeze afloat,

In a little pearly boet-

, Pearl within and round about, ’
And a siiken streamer out,
Over the sea, over the see,
Menily, menily saileth he!

. Not for battle, not for pelf,
But to pleasure his own self,
Sails he on for meny a leagne
Nor knoweth hunger nor fetigue ;
Past many a rock, past many a shore,
Nor shiste a sail, ner lifts an oar:
Ο the joy of xseiling thus,
Like a breve old N autilus 1
