THE MINSTREL’S LAST WISH.

0 CALEDONIA! stem and wild ·

Meet nurse for a poetic child

Land of brown heath and shaggy w00d‚
Land of the mountain and 1110 fiood,
Land of my sires 1 what mortal hand
Shall e’er untia 1110 filial band

That knits me to thy rugged strand?

still as I 1101100011 well-known soene,
'Think what is now and what has been3

Seems as to me of all bereft

Sole friends thy streams 01111 woods 0101011.
And thus I love them better still

Ev'n in extremity of ill.

By Yamow’s s'nream still 101 1110 ε11ογ,
,11100311 110110 should guido my feeble way;
still feel 1110 1110010 down Ettrick break,
Although it chill my wither'd cheek;

still lay my head on Teviotestone,

Though there, forgotten and alone„

The hard may draw his parting-grona.
