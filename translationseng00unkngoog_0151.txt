1. Some, wha hae wi Wallaee bled ;
Scots, whem Bruce has asten led ;
Welcome to your gory bed,

Orto glorious victorie.
Now's sshe day and now’s the hour ε
See the front of battle lour:
See approach proud Edward's pow'r,
Edward, chains and slaverie.

,Ι Wha will be a traitor knave2

Wha will fil] a coward’s greve?
Wha sae base as be a slave?
Traitm, eowaffl, turn and fiee!
Wha for Scotland's king and law
Freedom’seword will strongly draw,
Freeman stand or freeman fa',—
Caledoniam! on with me.

. By oppression’s woes and paine,
By our sons in servile chaine,
We will drain our dearest veins,
But they shall be, shall be free ἓ
· Lay the proud usurpers low3
Tyrants fall in every foe:
Libereie 's in every blew:
