And his double winga for hasty ssight,

And a keen unweerying appetite.

He oomes with Famine and Fear along,

An army amillion million strong.

The Goth and the Vandal, ond dwarfish Hun

Wibh his swanning people wild and dun,

Broughb not the dread that the locust bringa,

When is heard the rush of their myriad wings.
From the deserte of burning sand they apeed,

Ι Where the lions roam and the serpente breed,

Far over ‘the aea, away! away l

· And they darken the sun ai noon of day. Ι

Like Eden the land before they find,
But they leave it a desolate waste behind.

The pereant grows pale, when he sees them come„

And stondeth before them weak and dumb : ⁴

For they corne like e raging fire in power,

And eal up a harvest in half an hour.

The trees arebam, and the land is brown,

As if trampled and irod by on army down.

There is terror in every moneroh’s eye,

When ho hears thal this terrible foe ie nigb:

For he known that the might of an armed host

Cannot drive the spoiler from oui his coast ;

And that terror and famine his land aweit ;

Thai from north to south 'twill be desolate.
Thus the ravening Loeust is strong end grim:

And rrhat were an armed man to him?
