4. And in these wiid and verdant woods,
where stately moror tow'r,
Where hange from trenching trec to nec
The scarlet passion-fiow’r; ,

5. Where on the mighty river-banks,
La Plcte or Amazon,
The ocymen, like an old trec-trunk,
Lies basking in the sun 3

6. There builds her nest the humming-bird
Within the ancient wood,

Her nest, of eilky cottonoown 3
And reare her tiny brood,

7. She hange it to celender twig,
Wherc wcves it light and free,
As the Campanero tolle his song,

And rocks the mighty trec.

. 8. All orimson is her chining breest,
Like to the red red rose3

Her wing is the changeful green and bine
rhet the neck of the peccock shows.

9. Thou happy happy humming·bird 1
No winter round thee lours ι
Thon never eew’st a leeflcss trec
Nor land without eweet flow'rs.
