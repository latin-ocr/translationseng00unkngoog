In silence 00111010οκ-
They shook the depths 01 1110 <lesaii gloom
With their hymns 01 lofty eheer.

And the stars heard and the sea3
And the sounding 010100 01 the dim woods tang
To the anthem 011110 free.
The 0000000310 soar'd
From his nest by the white waves' foam,
An'd the rocking pines 01 the forest roar'd:
Thiswas their welcomehome. ’
4. There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band :
(Why had they come 10 wither there,
Away from their ehildhood's land 1)

Them was manhood's brow serenely high,
And tho fiery heart 01 youth.

Bright jewels 01 the mine 1
The walth 01 seas 1 the spoils 01 war 1

Ay, 0011 11 holy ground,
The 0011 where first they tmd :
They have 1011 0001011111 what them they found,-
hoedum* to worship God.
