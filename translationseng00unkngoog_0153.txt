ENGLAND’S DE‘AD..

1. Souofthe Ooean Isl'e;. ,

where sleep your mighty dead?

Show me what high and* staoeely pile
Is rear'd 0'er glorjs bed.
Go, stranger! track the· deep;
Free, free the white sail spread :

Wave may not foam, nor wiffi wind sweem
Where rest not England’s d'eadz

2. On Egypt’s buming plains
By the pyramid 0'erswafd,
With fearful pow’r the noonday aigum. ’
And the palm-trees yield no shade:
But let the angly sun ’
From heav’n look fieroely red,
Um‘elt by those whose task is done Ι.
There slumber England'n dead..

3. The hunicane hath might
Along the Indian shore ;
And far by Ganges’ banks αθ night
Is heard the tiger’s roar.
But let the sound roll on!
It hath no tone of dread
For those that from their toils ane gone ε
Thero elumber England's dead.
