1 think on thee at even,

When 1 see the fiat md suimet sur
Stenl pumen-l out of heaven.

1 henr thy sweeb ami bouching voice
In ench eost breem that bbwn,

Whethet it wast md autumn-leaf
Οι- fan the summer rose.

Mid the waste of yon lone beeth,
By thia desan monning εει,

1 moum sor thee, dem· Cha-lom,
And uhtu ever mom sor thee.

SUNNY ISLE OF OUR OWN.

1. 011 had we some bright nale isle of our own,
In a blue summer oman: fn: off and alone.
Whete a leaf never dies in the stin blooming bow‘n,
And the beu blaqussffz ou thmugh nwhole you· οἱ ἧπτες
Where the sun loves ω pauso ¹
With so fond a delay,
That the night only drawn
Athinvesso‘ertheday;
When simpl5 to feel that we brennae, tlnt we live,
Is wnnh thv hest joy that life elsewhem cau give.

Them, with souh ever mienss md pure ιε the dina,
We should laxe us they lov'd in tho fimt golden fine.
