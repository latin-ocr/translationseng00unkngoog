THE ΤΙΜΕ OF OHARLEMAGNE

· 1. Tum was plenty in tha foreet;

There was plenty on the plain3
Lusty pensante, noble heroea,
In the time of Charlemagne :
Right waa right and wrong was evil;
Truth was never then too plain ;
All the heart came forth in music,
In the time of Charlemagne
2. Every man was free to follow
Bird or wild beant to ite den ;
Every man maintained his quarrel
With the sword and not the pen:
Manly thoughts and simple habite

Brought us health‚ and banished pain: ’

We have changed,-(for worse or better l)
Since the time of Charlemngne.

- 3. Beauty won her bloom from'Nature3
Wives were constant, maidens true;
Men were bold, strong, clear, nubending,
Aa the breve bright eteel they drew;
None did risa but by hia merit ;
None <lid eell his seul for gain;
Words did never hide man's meaning,
In the time of Oharlemagne..
