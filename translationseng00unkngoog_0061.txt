The plough with wreaths was erown’dr
The hands ef kinge and seges
Entwin'd the ohaplee round3

By which the world was nomish’d,
And dews ef blood enrich'd the soil
Where green their laurele flourish’d„
Now the world her fault repaire,
The guile that stains her story 3 ·
And weeps her erimes amid the caree
Ther form’d her earliest glory.
