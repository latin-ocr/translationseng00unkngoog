Thie manuel ie poeulierly adepted to render the earlier stegee in the
acquisition of the Arabio lenguege much eeeier then they ere ordinerily
proved w be. For by en erret system of transliteretien 'of thet elphrbet

eontend, et once, with e strange languere end e strange chremetem end
while familiarieing him with the round of the mere remmon werde end eon-
amotione, it insensibly lende him to the knowledge of the original mode of
priting them. To those who wish to nequire end speek modern Arabio, this
work, by the singular paine taken to deflneend enforee the exuet sounde of
the spoken lenguege, offere edrmeeges very fer surpassing those of the moet
