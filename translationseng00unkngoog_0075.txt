THE OLD GRAY THRUSH.

1. OF all the birds of tuneful note,
That warble o'er field or ssood,

O give me the thrush with the speekled throat
The king of the ringing wood

2. For he sits upon the topmost twig,
To oarol forth his glee‚
And none can danoe a merrier j ig,
Or laugh more loud than he.

A. So the thrush, the thmsh, the old gray thrush,

A meny blithe old boy is he ;
You may hear him on the roadside bush
Or the topmost twig of the mountain tm&

3. Ere Spring, anayed ssn robes of green,
Bids beautiful fiow’rets start,
He oheereth up dull Decembeffs scene,
With a song from his gushing heart.

4. But sweeter far are his notes 1ο me,
When, piping 1ο the mom,

He woos the bright sun o'er the lea

With aflourish of his horn. '

A So the thrush, Sto.
