Where tho Pelioen of the silent North
Sits there all silently.
12. But if thou love the southern- sees
And pleasant summer westher,

Oomelet us mount this gallant ehip.
And soil away together.

THE SOUTHERN SEAS.

1. Yns, let us mount this gallnnt ship,
Spread oanvas to the wind,
Upi we will seek the glowing south,
Leeve care and cold behind. ¹
2. Let the shark punsne through the wetere blue·
Our fiying vessel’s trech,
Let strong winds blow and rocks below
Threeten 3-we turn not back.
3. Trusting in Him who holds the seov
In his Almighty hand,
We'll pass the awfnl wetere wide,
Tread many a far off strand
4. Right onwerd as our course we hold„
From day to day the sky
Above our head ite arch shall spread
More glowing, bright end high.
5. And from night to night, oh what delight
In its ezuro depths to mark

Stans all unknown come glitt’ring out
Over the ocean dark.
