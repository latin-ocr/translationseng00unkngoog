viii.

The analogous paradox of final m is' -explicable
bytho hypothesis to which the phenomenon of coll
and co points; vin, the m, even in prose, was not
sounded ot cll before a vowel. This reversas the ·
French practice, which has two modes of pro-
·nouncing half the words of the language: but
their final consonant is sounded, not¹ before a con·
sonant, but before a vowel. If the Latins in prose
said: “Bellum quidem campestre novi,’' but,
“ Bellu equidem campestre novi,’' we can under-
stand that
· Bellu equidem novi campestre——

Bella equidem novi campestria—
are equally good for Dactylic rhythm 3 while
’ Bellum quidem novi campestre-
is not good.
Be this as it may, Ι cannot bear· to cut off the

m of monosyllableS, nor of any word il a great stop
follows ; as No. 6, line 6 from end. In No. l, linc

15, it would be easy to write virorum3 but I prefer Ν

virum. Latin poets seem to evade altogether the
use of cum, Nam, dam, Quom, dre, before a
vowel: but this may become a slavery. Ι hope

that Ι cannot corrupt the taste of leamers by ·

making Cum api an anapaest ond J am huic an
iamb.
