2: I’ve seen our loveliest maidens τ
Their eyes as 11111 are bright.
Their voices 110 sweet 11 1 fountain’s,
That murmure in 1110 light.
But they were 1101 a joy 10 me,
As 111011, when I look on thee. ’
Pale Lily of 1110 waher, sweel fiowrl sleep.
3. Why ‹lroope‘hh thy head, lone captive?
Mourn not 1110 low'd ones blest.
In 1110 white men's happy islands
Their spirits are 11 rest. ’
Thy image 10 them shall heom,
As they are behold in thy dream.
Pale Lily of 1110111101, sweet fiow'r 1 sleep.

4. My brother is rude 10 thy sorrow 3'
He heth ewarrior’s soul
He is herrihle in the battle:
He sconis 1 maid’s controul .
But 1111 in our father's home
Thou 111111 in my bosom bloom.
Pale Lily of 1111 water, sweet fiow’rl sleep.
