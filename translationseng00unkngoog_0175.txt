Hork 1-0 blow, and a dull sound follows,

A seoond-he bowe hio head ;
A third—end the wood’s dark hollows
Now know that their king is deod
2. His arms from their trnnk are riven3 '
His body eil barked and squared;
And he’s now, like a selon driven
In chains 10 the strong dookyerd:
He’s sown through ohe middle, end humed
For the ribs of e frigete free 3 ’
And he’s oeulked, ond pitohed, ond humed3
And now-he’s fit for sea!
3. Oh! noo-woh ns wings 001ρο01- -
Like e ghost (if a ghost moy be),
He will triumph oooein, though deod.
And be dieeded in every sea :
The‘lightning will blaze about,
And wrnp him in fiaming pride 3
’ And the thunder·loud oennon will 011001,
¹ · In the fighe from his bold broodside.
4. And when he has foughh and won,
And been honoured from shore 10 shore ;
And his Journey on earth is done,-
· Why, what oen he onk for moreh
There is neught that a king oen einim,
⁴ Or a poet 'or warrior hold, ⁸
Save a rhyme and e short-lived neme,
And 10 mix with the common mould
