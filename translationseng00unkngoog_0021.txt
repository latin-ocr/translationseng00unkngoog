OANADIAN BOAT SONG.

1. Frrrsm as tells the svening chime,

Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time;

Soon as the woods on shore look dim,
We'll sing at Se Ann’s our parting hyrmr
Row, brothers ro'w; the stream runs fsst;

, The repids are near, and the daylight ’s past. Ι

2. Why should we yet our ssil unfurl 2
· There i's not a breeth the bluewave to curl:
But when the wind blows off the shore,
Oh sweetly we’ll rest our weery oar.
Blow, breezes blow3 the stream runs fest3
The rspids are near, and thedeylight ’s pest.

3. Ottewa's tide! this trembling moon
Shall see us floet 0’er thy surges soon.
Saint of this green isle! hear our pray'rs3 ·
Oh grant us 0001 heavens and favouring airs.
Blow, breezes, blorv, &e
