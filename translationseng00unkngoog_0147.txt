5. When erimson sky and flamy cloud
Bespeek the summer o’er, ’ ’
And the dead velleys wear 'a ehroud·
01 snows that *molt no more,
¹ ΙἸΙ build 01 ine thy winter-home
With glistoningwnlls and glassy dome,
And spread with skins the floor. ¹
6. The white fox by ὼγ eoueh shall play;
- And from the frozen skies
The meteors of emimic day
Shaii flaeh before thine eyes : ·
· And I (foi such ὼγ vow) meanwhile
Sheil hear ὼγ voice and see ὼγ smile,

THE PILGRIM FATHERS.

1. Tfflr breaking waves dash'd high
ἵ On a stem and took-bound coast,
And the woods against a stormy sky
Their giant brenches ross’d.
And the heavy night hung dnrk
The hiils and wetere o'er,
When a band 01 exiles moor’d their berk
On the wild New England shore.
2. Not en ihe conqueror eomer,
They the inuehenrted eame;
· Not with the 1011 01 the stirring drums
And the trumpet that sings 01 fame.
