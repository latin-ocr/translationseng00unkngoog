MIDHOUR OF NIGHT.

Ι.

AT the midhour of nighh‚ when stans are weeping, I fly y
To the lone valo we lov'd‚ when life was warm in hhine eye.

And Ι think, that if spirits oen steol from the regions of air
’Το revisit past soenes of delight, thou wilh eome to me there,

And tell me our love is remember'd‚ ev'n in the sky.

ι 11.

Thon I sing the wild song it once was rapturo to hear,
When our voices oommingling breath'd like one onthe ear.
And as tho far off through the vele my sad orison rolls,
I think, O my lowel 'tis thyvoioe from the kingdom of seule,
Faintly answering still the notes that onee wem so deor.

OHAMOUNI.

Semo long unknown to stranger sight,
Moke all thy wolon, romantio Chamouni,
, Α wonder and dolight.
The goatherd and the shopherd and their flocln

Pesturing the crags around;
