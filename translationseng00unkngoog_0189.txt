“My telumue semum

1. WHERE hest thou been, my beautiful Spn'ngt

To the sultry South, on the swallow's wing?

Kissing the little kidnepp’d slave,

Ere borne away 011 the deep blue wevel

Brushing the tear from the mother's eheek,

As she wept for her child et Mozembiquel

Else, whence comest thou with this potent ehem,
Oheining the winde to the fn'gid zone;

Making the breaet of nature warm,
And stilling old Winter's undertenel

⁶. Where llast thou' been, my beautiful Springt ”

Away with the honey-bee wandering 2

Sipping the neuter of fem'd (leehmerel

Sporting amid the Turks perterre?

Qwaffing warm Araby’s balmy breem,

And spiey scente of the Oeylonesel

Elee, whence comest thou with thy odorous breeth,
Ohafing the oheek to erosy bloom, γ

And seattering the poisonous air of death,
By flinging abroad a rich persumet

3. Where hast thou been, my beautiful Springl
Up, mid Heav'n’s music revelling?
For the tenes of thy song from the greenwood bush,
The lerk inthe sky, and the mountain thrael,
