4. sse bloom of the seasdns will come, will hy:
And the heavens will alter, we know not why3

But the mind that we temper is our domein 3
· And the truth of the Spirih should eonquer pain

MELROSE ABBEY.

In thou would’st view fair hIelrose night,

Go visit it by the pale moonhght;

For the gay benms of hghtsome day

Gild but to flent the ruins gray.

When the broken arches ale bleek in night,
And each shasted oriel glimmers white :

,When the eold light‘s uncertain shower
Streams on the ruin’d eentral tower;

When buttoess and buttress alternately

Seem frnm'd of ebon and ivory;

When silver edges the imagery,

And the serolls that teach thee to lire and die ;
When distant Tweed is heard to reve,

And the owlet to hoot o'er the dead mnn's greve 3
Then gre-but go alone the while,-

Then view Se David’s ruined pile;

And home returning, soothly swern,

Wes never scene so sad and fair.
