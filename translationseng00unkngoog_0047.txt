13. Heaving and sinking, soft and fair,

Here hyacinth, there green,
With many a stem of golden gmwth
And stari-y florere between.

14. But away! away to upper day;
For menstruus shepes are here:
Menatem of dark and wallowing bulk
And horny eyeballs drear.
15. The tusked mouth and the spiny fin,
Speekled and warted back,
The glittering swift and the flahby slew,
Ramp thmugh this deep seatraak
16. Away! away to upper day,
To glanae 0’er the breezy brine,
And see the nautilus gladly sail,
The flying fish leap and shine.

17. But what is that? 'tis land, 'tis land:
’Tis land; the sailors cry.
N ay ε 'tis a long and narrowg cloud,
Betwixt the sea and sky.
18. 'Tis land, 'tis land; they cry once more:
And now eomes breathing on
An odour of the living earth,
Such aa the eea hath none.
19. But now I mark the rising eborea,

The purple hiils, the trees ;
Ah! what a glorious land is here Ξ .

What happy soenes are these 1
