5. From hhe streame and founte I have loosed the chain:
They are sweeping on to the silvery mein
They are flashing down from the mountain browe,
They are flinging spray 0'er the forest boughs.
They are hursting fresh fmm hheir sparry caves,
And the ear‘th reeounds with the joy of weves.

’ . Come forth, Ο ye children of gledness, eome !
Where the violets lie may be now your home.
Ye of the rose-hp and dew-bright eye

. And the bounding footehep‚ to meet me fly.
With the lyre and the wreath and the joyous lay
Comeforth ho the sunshine : I may not stay.

. Away from the dwellings of care-worn men :
The wetere are sparkling in grove and glen.

Away from the ehnmher and sullen hearth :
The young leaves are dancing in breezy nnrhh.

Their light ntems thrill to the wild-wood strains,
And youth ie ahroad in my green domains.
