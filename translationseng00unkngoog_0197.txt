Wnna first the fiery manbled Snn Δ
His heavenly raee began to run,
Round the earth and ocean blue
His children four, the Seasona flew.
First, in green apparel daneing, ’
The young ξυνίης] smil’d with angel-grace.
Rosy Sumam next advanaing
Rush'd into her sire's embraae;
Her bright-hair'd aire, who bade her keep
For ever nearest to his smiles,
011 Calpe’s olive-shaded sheep,
On India’s nitran-,eoverd islea ’
More remote, and-buxom-brown, 3 -
The Quaen of Vimaye bow'd befaie hia thmne ε

But howling maer fied afar

Ι ’ ι’ To hius thar prop the paler stan

And lovea on deor-borne car to ride,
- , With barren Darkness by his side,

, - Romane shore, where loud Losoden

Whirls to death the roaring whale;

” noune aa hals, where aune ona

Howls hie war-song to the gale.
